# digital_display
Automation code for running all of the Makerspace's digital displays.

At present we only have the one 60" LG display. I image we'll get more and the automation scripts we have for them should be consolidated here for knowlege sharing.

# Feature requests:
 + Periodically update and reboot browser
 + Check wifi connection and reset if needed.
 + Periodically reboot machine & turn off TV. Allow booth to cool off.
